<h1>The App</h1>
<p><h2><b>What is Campus Odd Jobs?</b></h2></p>
<p><p align="justify">Got some errands to run, but just don't have the time? Got some extra time on your hands and want to earn some quick cash? Campus Odd Jobs is an app that allows UCONN students to post and complete odd jobs for fake internet karma, but more importantly, real-life cash!</p>
<p><p align="justify">With the Campus Odd Jobs app, you can get in touch with students who either have work for you so you can earn some extra cash for your Rainy Day fund (or your Make It Rain fund), or students who can run those errands that you simply don't have the time, energy, or motivation to finish! This app lets you post jobs, find jobs that need to be completed, and get in touch with other students... all in one snazzy interface.</p>
<p><h6>(App currently available only on Android. Sorry, Apple fanatics; maybe next time!)</h6></p>
